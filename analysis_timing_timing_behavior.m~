    %Each of these objects sets the stage to calculate the mutual
    %information between spike timing of neuron 1 and spike timing of neuron 2 and stores the results of
    %the calculation. 
    
    % For this type of calculation, it is likely that we will have to be creative
    % maybe we will use the average ISI in a breath cycle
    % maybe we will use only the first spike
    % We will have to see how much data we have.
